# openlibrary
An open source Library Management System

OpenLibrary is an online library management system that can be used to open a library, catalogue books, checkout and return books, and maintain a wishlist. 
This is only a server side project, and as such, I am looking for collaboraters who will contribute to build mobile and browser clients.
